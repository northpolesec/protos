# North Pole Security Protos

This repository contains protobuf definitions used by [Santa](https://github.com/northpolesec/santa).

It also contains generated Go code for these protos, so that the protos can be
imported by projects that don't use Bazel as their build system. There is a
GitHub actions workflow that will automatically re-generate the Go code upon
push/pull request.

If it would be helpful to have BUILD rules or pre-generated files for other
languages, please open an Issue.
